[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-kine--sight.vercel.app-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://kine-sight.vercel.app)

**Kine-Sight** is a cutting-edge digital fitness trainer with an "eye." By leveraging on-device Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it watches your form, tracks your progress, catches your mistakes, and provides real-time, actionable feedback to help you perfect your fitness journey. 

Everything runs **100% locally in your browser** via WebAssembly—meaning zero server costs, zero API keys, and complete privacy for your camera feed.

## ✨ Features

- **👀 Real-Time Vision Tracking:** Uses your device's camera to analyze your posture, reps, and movements in real-time.
- **🗣️ Interactive Feedback:** Get instant corrections and motivational feedback when your form breaks down.
- **🔒 100% Private & Secure:** Powered by `@runanywhere/web`, all AI inference happens locally on your device. Your camera feed never leaves your browser.
- **⚡ Blazing Fast On-Device AI:** Utilizes optimized WASM engines to run Vision (LFM2-VL) and Text (LFM2) models directly in the web browser.
- **🎙️ Voice Integration:** Speak to your AI trainer naturally, and it will respond via text-to-speech.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite

## 🧠 How It Works Under the Hood

- Kine-Sight is built on top of the **RunAnywhere SDK**. It uses a combination of powerful local models.
- **VLM** (Vision-Language Model): Captures frames from your webcam and analyzes your body positioning.
- **LLM** (Large Language Model): Processes the vision data to formulate encouraging text or corrective instructions.
- **Voice Pipeline** (VAD, STT, TTS): Allows you to ask the trainer questions hands-free while working out.
